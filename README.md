This repository consists of all the files that we created and used for our project in C entitled "Hospital Management System".
The HMS aims to replace the use of traditional ledgers with more organised and systematic way of storing details about a patients health.
There are uses of different basic C functions and data types to create a cohesive and hopefully a positive impact driven program.

Anyone can view and use these files as their wish but a small credit to the authors would be really appreciated.
Any faults in the codes and suggestions for better approach for running the code is welcome.
